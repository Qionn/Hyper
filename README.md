# Hyper

Hyper is my final exam project for Programming 4. It's a game engine I built to learn about game development. It's beginner-friendly and allows me to create small games. it is a valuable experience that enhances my game development skills.

## Examples

Hyper includes several example projects to help you get started with game development. These projects showcase different features of the toolkit and provide a starting point for your own games.

* [Burger Time](examples/burger_time): A classic arcade-style game featuring 2D graphics and simple input handling.
