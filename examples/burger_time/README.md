Burger Time is a classic arcade game that was released in 1982 by Data East. This is a remake of the original game, featuring updated graphics and modern keyboard or gamepad controls. In this game, the player controls a chef named Peter Pepper, who must build giant burgers while avoiding hostile food items such as hot dogs, pickles, and eggs. The game features colorful graphics, catchy music, and challenging gameplay that made it a popular hit in arcades during the 1980s.

## Game Modes

Burger Time features three different game modes:

### Single Player

In single player mode, the player must complete all levels on their own. The game has six levels, each with a different burger that must be assembled. The levels become progressively more difficult as the game goes on, with more enemy food items and more complex burger designs. The player must reach the top of each level and complete the burger before the time runs out. If the player completes all six levels, they will see the ending sequence.

### Versus Mode

In versus mode, two players can compete against each other to see who can complete the burgers first. Each player has their own half of the screen, and they must race to build the burgers while avoiding enemy food items. The first player to complete all six burgers wins the game. This mode only be player locally.

### Coop Mode

In coop mode, two players can work together to complete the burgers. The players share a single screen, and they must coordinate their movements to avoid the enemy food items and build the burgers. This mode can also be played locally or online.
